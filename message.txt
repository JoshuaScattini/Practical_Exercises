Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.  You have 
to see it for yourself. This is your last chance.  After this, 
there is no going back.  You take the blue pill and the story
ends.  You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to
believe. You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how
deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember that all I am offering is
the truth.  Nothing more.
